# Tanzania-Water-system
The data used here comes from the Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water. Our goal is to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset.
Motivation: An understanding of which waterpoints will fail, can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

Here, I used XGBClassifier and Xgboost(logistic regression) to predict the functionalities and classifier was more better than regression.
Tools Used include: Python, sckit-learn, matplotlib, numpy
